I have been a chronic non-finisher. Recently someone asked me about my portfolio. I instantly felt that inward grimace. I still haven't done anything meaningful with the ruby skills that I have accumulated over the last 4 years, so here goes!

 This blog will be my marker in the sand.

 I will continue to dig through the random dev materials in my own self-directed fashion but this time I will try and document the most interesting stuff I happen upon here in this blog.

Wish me luck.
